Base Pay is a payment solution designed to enable one-tap USDC payments within applications built on the Base network, an Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Coinbase. It allows developers to integrate fast, low-cost, and secure USDC payments without the complexities of traditional payment systems. Base Pay is built to work seamlessly with Base Accounts, which are smart-wallet-backed accounts that provide universal sign-on, one-tap payments, and private profile vaults for user data.
