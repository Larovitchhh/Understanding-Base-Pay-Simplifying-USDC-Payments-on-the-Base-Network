Base Pay is part of a broader ecosystem designed to make blockchain accessible to the next billion users. By combining the scalability of an Ethereum Layer 2 with the simplicity of smart wallets, Base Pay offers a compelling alternative to traditional payment systems. Its integration with Coinbase and support for familiar funding methods like Apple Pay and debit cards further lowers the barrier to entry for users.

For developers, the ability to integrate payments with minimal code and no wallet connection overhead makes Base Pay an attractive choice. The SDKâ€™s compatibility with various frameworks and its support for advanced features like user data collection and server-side validation provide flexibility for a wide range of use cases.
